			<br />
			<p> i found out from an early time in my coding career that i had a passion for building hacky tools and what not. this passion led me to my first project i ever built! </p> 
			<p>std, which stands for shit to do, was a really fun and simple project that i have continuously gotten to hack on throughout my humble career in software. </p>
			<p>std is a way to manager all of your tasks using vim and some simple bash setup. all i did for my setup was run the executable by creating an alias in my bash profile!</p>
			<p>i got to build this project purely in go, and was able to expand on the original idea by exploring some of go's community-built frameworks. </p>
			<p>specifically i got to understand how databases work by using boltdb, which is an embedded, key value database written purely in go! you can check  out how i used their database in an example <a href="https://github.com/benmorehouse/std/blob/cf3f76d6314284cc407082ae0a754485d63d0c95/functions.go#L22">here</a>.</p>
			<p>i also got to build out the cli with a fun framework called cobra. you can see the code for that <a href="https://github.com/benmorehouse/std/blob/cf3f76d6314284cc407082ae0a754485d63d0c95/commands.go#L16">here</a>.</p>
			<p> the project has become a center for my workflow both at school, on personal projects, and at my positions as a software engineer. all in all, a very humbling and exciting first project! </p>

				<h5 class="center-align"><a href="github.com/benmorehouse/rtc" target="_blank"> rtc </a></h5>
				<div class="thin-short"></div>	
				<br />
				<p>this was another really fun project that helped me solidify my passion for tooling. </p>
				<p>rtc stands for rescuetime cli. rescuetime is an application that allows for the tracking of your time you spend on your laptop. </p>
				<p>i found it counter-intuitive to have to leave the command line to see how you were doing on your productivity for that day, so i decided to build this in order to fix that issue and keep you in your terminal longer!</p>
				<p>i got to build this tool using go, and again was able to expand on the project by using my two favorite frameworks: boltdb and cobra!</p>
				<p>i really focused this project on my ability to get something tangible to work quickly and efficiently. the final product is something that i am really happy with for right now, and am really excited to expand on it soon!</p>

				<p> this is the repository for my internship i had at the marshall school of business at usc. you can read more about what i did <a class="waves-effect" href="work-experience.html">here</a>.</p>

				<h5 class="center-align"><a href="github.com/benmorehouse/basicInterpreter" target="_blank"> a basic interpreter </a></h5>
				<div class="thin-short"></div>	
				<br />
				<p> i got to build a really cool interactive webapp with an internally built basic interpreter!</p>
				<p> this project was inspired by my second cultivated passion that i got from a class i took on data structures and algorithms at usc</p>
				<p> i got to build the frontend server side code along with the help of some internally implemented TCP libraries offered in go (take a look at net/http). I also was able to do some fun things with javascript, ajax, and of course html and css for the frontend. </p>
				<p> i built the actual interpreter with c++, and was able to really get a good understanding of objected oriented programming through this fun assignment. </p>
				<p> it still has a bit to go, as I have been able to build the interpreter but am still in the process of building the front end! </p>
			<div class="thin-line"></div>	
				<h5 class="center-align"><a href="https://github.com/benmorehouse/javascriptPresentation" target="_blank"> Javascript Framework Presentation </a></h5>
				<p> this is a presentation that I gave to a class at usc about the current state of the framework community and the web development community. </p>
				<p> i built the website using reactjs, and was able to explore things such as how the react router works, the best ways touse component-based development, and also about how other frameworks differ from react (which is eventually why i chose react over any of the other ones there).. </p>

				<h5 class="center-align"><a href="github.com/benmorehouse/mars" target="_blank"> Helper </a></h5>
